Creation of earth

4.6 billion years ago there was gas and dust orbiting our young sun.
With these particles and gas started to collide and condense it formed a planetesimal (baby planet). 
Once the planetesimal had enough heat and energy heavier elements sunk to the core and
this is when Earth was formed. The planet was way too hot to have solidify rocks.
