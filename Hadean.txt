4.6 to 4 billion years ago, due to the dynamic of the earth plate tectonics
 we do not have any rocks this old except meteorites.
The Solar System was still forming during this time period.
 The earth at the time stabilized its core and crust it also 
developed its oceans and atmosphere. Due to Bombardment of meteorites
 and planetesimals crust was molten hot and couldnâ€™t solidify due to the 
 release of all impact energy.
