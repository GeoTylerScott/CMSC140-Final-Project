# CMSC140-Final-Project
Final Project for Python 140
My Final Project is a  condensed user interference of the geological history of the earth. Click on a era or 
eon and it will take you to a module that has a brief description of geological events. I would use 
If else statements to dictate if someone chose this eon than bring up this topic from a function. 
Also, I would use while loop to keep the interface going until the quit command is used.
