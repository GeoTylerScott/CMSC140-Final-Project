The Paleoproterozoic


The Paleoproterozoic started right after the Archean eon (2.5 billion years to 1.6 billion). 
At this time Earths plate tectonics started to become active. 
This started to shape the topography of Earth with plates collision and plates pulling each other apart 
which leads to mountain building and increase
the size of the continents. Evidence of Eukaryotes appeared around ~ 1Billion years during this time. 
Due to the oxygen being toxic to anaerobic species, any lifeforms that were anaerobic died having anaerobic species 
living in oxygen-free environments. No evidence of lifeforms being aerobic at this time.
